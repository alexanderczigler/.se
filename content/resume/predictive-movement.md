I coordinated the real-world tests where we travelled to Ljusdal and Pajala respectively to learn about the transport industry and to test our hypotheses. The preparations for each test included conducting interviews, demonstration our platform and the ideas underlying the research project and structuring my own and the team's learning journey.

I also worked on the code from time to time and worked on the hosting environment as well.
