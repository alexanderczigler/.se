<h3>Experience</h3>

<p>
  I am going to add my resum√© here soon. In the mean time, check out my <a
    href="https://linkedin.com/in/alexanderczigler">LinkedIn profile</a
  >.
</p>

<h3>Social</h3>

<p>
  If you are curious about some of the non work-related aspects of me, you can find me on a few
  social platforms as well. Feel free to send me a friend request if you happen to use any of them.
</p>

<p>
  I use <a href="https://goodreads.com/alexanderczigler">Goodreads</a> to track the books I read. I
  rarely actually write reviews but I am quite active keeping my own library and to-read list
  updated. I also enjoy learning new languages on
  <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/profile/alexanderczigler">Duolingo</a> where I am currently learning
  Italian.

  If you are into deep house, techno or retrowave, check out my <a
    href="https://soundcloud.com/alexanderczigler">SoundCloud</a

  profile. And last but not least you can find me on
  <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/60476104">Strava</a> where I track most of my workouts and
  walks.
