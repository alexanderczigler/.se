  I am a self-taught software developer currently working as a backend engingeer at <a
    href="https://iteam.se/">Iteam Solutions</a
  > in Stockholm.
</p>

<p>
  My passion for software and the web began in the late 90's when I started learning basic HTML and
  making homepages. When I got DSL in the early 00's I built my first server and started learning
  about linux and setting up networks, web servers and firewalls. Since then I have been learning
  more and more all the time by continuous exploration and by surrounding myself with talented
  people who inspire me to learn and grow.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of computers and technology I enjoy reading, working out and being outdoors in nature. One
  of my latest hobbies that I have picked up is dancing. I took classes learning Lindy Hop a few
  years ago and after that I switched to poledancing which I still practice regularly. Along with
  dancing I also pratice yoga and some basic acrobatics such as handbalancing.

<h3>Experience</h3>

<p>
  I am going to add my resum√© here soon. In the mean time, check out my <a
    href="https://linkedin.com/in/alexanderczigler">LinkedIn profile</a

<h3>Social</h3>

<p>
  If you are curious about some of the non work-related aspects of me, you can find me on a few
  social platforms as well. Feel free to send me a friend request if you happen to use any of them.
</p>

<p>
  I use <a href="https://goodreads.com/alexanderczigler">Goodreads</a> to track the books I read. I
  rarely actually write reviews but I am quite active keeping my own library and to-read list
  updated. I also enjoy learning new languages on
  <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/profile/alexanderczigler">Duolingo</a> where I am currently learning
  Italian.
