  <h1>Hello</h1>

  <p>
    I am a self-taught software developer &amp; devops engineer currently working at <a
      href="https://iteam.se/"
      target="_blank">Iteam Solutions</a
    > in Stockholm.
  </p>

  <p>
    My passion for software and the web began in the late 90's when I started learning basic HTML
    and making homepages. In 2002 I built my first server from computer parts and started learning
    about linux and setting up networks, web servers and firewalls. From my early teens and
    throughout my career I have been on a continuous journey of learning and exploration. After I
    started working as a consultant in Stockholm I have been very lucky to be able to surround
    myself with talented people who inspire me to learn and grow.

    Outside of computers and tech I am also passionate about dancing and yoga. I practice
    poledancing and acrobatics regularly and I also enjoy cooking and reading.

  <h2>Social</h2>

  <p>
    If you are curious about some of the non work-related aspects of me, you can find me on a few
    social platforms as well. Feel free to send me a friend request if you happen to use any of
    them.
  </p>

  <p>
    I use <a href="https://goodreads.com/alexanderczigler">Goodreads</a> to track the books I read.
    I rarely actually write reviews but I am quite active keeping my own library and to-read list
    updated. I also enjoy learning new languages on
    <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/profile/alexanderczigler">Duolingo</a> where I am currently learning
    Italian.

    walks.
