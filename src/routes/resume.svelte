  <h1>Resumé</h1>

  <p>
    I have many years experience being a consultant. First from work as a freelance developer and
    then from working at three different consultancy firms since 2008 and forward. As a consultant I
    have been lucky to work with many different clients. I have help startups take off; I have
    helped an international bank adopt container technology and becoming more agile and many things
    in-between.
  </p>

  <p>
    What characterizes my career and each project I have worked on is learning. I love learning new
    things and what I love even more is learning and growing alongside other people who share the
    same goals. I think that we are quickly approaching a time where organizations need to adopt a
    culture of learning and high functioning teams to be able to survive. Those who fail will find
    it hard to keep up and reinvent themselves.
