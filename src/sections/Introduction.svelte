  I am a self-taught software developer currently working as a backend engingeer at <a
    href="https://iteam.se/">Iteam Solutions</a
  > in Stockholm.

  My passion for software and the web began in the late 90's when I started learning basic HTML and
  making homepages. When I got DSL in the early 00's I built my first server and started learning
  about linux and setting up networks, web servers and firewalls. Since then I have been learning
  more and more all the time by continuous exploration and by surrounding myself with talented
  people who inspire me to learn and grow.

  Outside of computers and technology I enjoy reading, working out and being outdoors in nature. One
  of my latest hobbies that I have picked up is dancing. I took classes learning Lindy Hop a few
  years ago and after that I switched to poledancing which I still practice regularly. Along with
  dancing I also pratice yoga and some basic acrobatics such as handbalancing.
